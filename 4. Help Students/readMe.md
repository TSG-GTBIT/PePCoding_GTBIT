<h1>Help Students</h1>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

1. You will be given a number N representing the number of students.
1. The students want to play game but their teacher will only allow the students to go to playground if all the students arrange themselves in a specific order, according to height.

The order is 0th student(the one who will stand in front) will be smaller in height than the student at 1st position, and the 1st student will be larger in height than the student at 2nd position, 2nd will be smaller than the one standing at the 3rd position, and so on.

eg: there are 7 students with height :- 4, 3, 7, 8, 6, 2, 1
then the order will be : 3, 7, 4, 8, 2, 6, 1

You have to write a solution such that it will produce a order which will help the students to for games.
